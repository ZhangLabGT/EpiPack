Installation guide
==================

************
Main package
************

The ``epipackpy`` package can be installed via pip using the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install epipackpy

.. note::
    For GPU-based Pytorch installation, we recommend installing the ``torch`` package on
    `pytorch portal <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`__
    after checking the CUDA version by ``nvidia-smi``.

Now you are all set. Refer to `tutorials <tutorials.rst>`__ for how to use the ``epipackpy`` package.
