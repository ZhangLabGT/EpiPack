# EpiPack ![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.1-blue.svg)

---

## Description
EpiPack is a modular deep learning toolkit for **single-cell ATAC-seq reference mapping, cell label annotation, and out-of-reference (OOR) detection**.  
By introducing heterogeneous transfer learning and peak-informed variational inference (PEIVI), EpiPack enables scalable construction of harmonized reference atlases and robust query mapping across diverse scATAC-seq datasets. It further provides **global-local OOR detection frameworks** for discovering novel cell types or perturbed cellular states with interpretable uncertainty estimation. Please see our manuscript for more details.
